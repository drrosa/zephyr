# Zephyr

Zephyr is simple instant chat application built with Django that allows multiple users to engage in conversations and interact with a large language model (LLM). This platform aims to combine real-time chatting capabilities with the intelligence of GPT-based models, hoping to provide users with unique and engaging conversational experiences.
